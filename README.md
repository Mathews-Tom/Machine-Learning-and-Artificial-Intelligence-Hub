All courses, projects and resources on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that I have curated personally and always growing over the period of time. Anyone hoping to pursue through the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence industry, I hope might find the content helpful in learning, improving their skills and grow their experience or just find tools that might aid in the process.

## Courses

- **[Master of Science in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/MSc_in_Machine_Learning_and_Artificial_Intelligence)** - Master of Science in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence by UpGrad in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology, Madras & Liverpool John Moores University.

- **[Deep Learning Specialization](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Deep_Learning_Specialization)** - The Deep Learning Specialization, by DeepLearning.AI, is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.

- **[MIT 6S.191 - Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/MIT_6S.191-Introduction_to_Deep_Learning)** - MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Course concludes with a project proposal competition with feedback from staff and panel of industry sponsors. This repository contains all of the code and software labs for [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)! All lecture slides and videos are available on the course website.

## Projects

- **[EDA Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/EDA_Bank_Loan_Default_Risk_Analysis)** - The case study aims to provide an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- **[Weather Prediction using Neural Network](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/FormulaAIHackathon)** - Hackmakers Formula AI Hackathon 2022: Weather Prediction using Neural Network.
- **[E-Commerce Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/E_Commerce_Dataset_Analysis)** - Use skills and understanding of HIVE and Hadoop concepts to extract data, load data into HIVE tables and gather insights from the data set.
- **[US Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/US_Patent_Phrase_to_Phrase_Matching)** - Train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. 
- **[Deep Neural Networks Examples](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Deep_Neural_Networks_Examples)** - Deep Neural Network examples to represent different concepts in Deep Neural Networks. Projects/Examples part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
- **[Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm & PySpark](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Market_Basket_Analysis_Apriori_PySpark)** - Market Basket Analysis is a¬†**data mining**¬†technique that helps to understand the relationship between the items sold by the company. As the name suggests, the method tries to analyse the customer basket or the transaction data to identify any association between items. The results from this analysis help the companies to develop marketing strategies to increase their revenue by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers. This project aims at doing Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm & PySpark.
