All courses and projects on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that I have cleared and might be helpful for anyone hoping to improve their skills and grow their experience.

## Course

- [Master of Science in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/MSc_in_Machine_Learning_and_Artificial_Intelligence) - Master of Science in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence by UpGrad in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology, Madras & Liverpool John Moores University.

- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Deep_Learning_Specialization) - The Deep Learning Specialization, by DeepLearning.AI, is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.

## Projects

- [EDA Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/EDA_Bank_Loan_Default_Risk_Analysis) - This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- [Weather Prediction using Neural Network](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/FormulaAIHackathon) - Hackmakers Formula AI Hackathon 2022: Weather Prediction using Neural Network.
- [E Commerce Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/E_Commerce_Dataset_Analysis) - Use your skills and understanding of HIVE and Hadoop concepts to extract data, load data into HIVE tables and gather insights from the data set.
- [Deep Neural Networks Examples](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Deep_Neural_Networks_Examples)
